Prerequisites & Compatibility
-----------------------------

The module has been tested on versions of Python from 2.4 to 2.7 plus Python 3.2
running on WinXP, Win7 & Win2k3. It may also work on older (or newer) versions.
It's tested with the most recent pywin32 extensions, but the functionality
it uses from those libraries has been in place for many versions.
